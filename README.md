Morso!

A remake of an old DOS game Beast by Dan Baker
https://dosgames.com/game/beast/

It's a game I played as a child but couldn't find anywhere. I wanted to make a mostly faithful remake of it, just for fun. Then someone who I shared this to recognized the game and I'm happy to be reunited with it.

I'll still continue this, as I have ideas for expanding it a little. And it's still missing a few features anyhow since I couldn't remember everything.

## How to run
You need Python 3.10 or newer to run "python -m server.py" in a command prompt or terminal, in the project root folder. Then access localhost:8000 with your browser. You can close the server process with CTRL+C.
